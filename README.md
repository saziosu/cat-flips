# User Experience

The goal of the site is to be brightly colored and attractive to the user, while accessible and easy to use and understand.
<br>
The name entry at the start of the game offers a personalised experience for the user.
<br>
The moves and timer are easily viewed by the user during the game, so they can be aware of their stats at any moment.

## User Stories

  * As a first time User, we want the site to be attracitve and easy to use across many devices.
  * As a first time User, we want to be able to immediately play again without refreshing the page.
* Returning User

The modal at the start of the game welcomes the user to the game, and asks them to input their name. 
The button tells the user that the game will start when it is clicked, letting them know that the time begins when they click the button.

### Cards

The back face of the cards are immediately seen on starting the game. They are all clickable and are consistent with the color scheme.

### Game Stats

![](assets/images/readme-images/game-stats.png)

The game stats part of the page shows the user's name that they entered in the starting modal. It also tracks their time in seconds and the number of moves they have made.
The reset button allows the user to control the game and start afresh, by resetting the moves and time and shuffling the cards.

### End Modal

![](assets/images/readme-images/end-modal.png)

The end modal is consistent in style and color with the start modal. It congradulates the user on their win and provides them with their end moves and the number of seconds it took to complete the game.
The button entices the user to play the game again. This button resets the time and moves and also shuffles the cards.
